# Progress report 1

The subject of our design project is the rise of cryptocurrencies. Over time, cryptocurrencies have become all the more present. They are one of the most significant examples of block chain technology. Moreover, they are quite controversial â€“ some argue that we should welcome this digital revolution, whereas others are afraid of the influence of cryptocurrencies. Additionally, there is discussion whether or not cryptocurrencies will ultimately overtake physical currencies. Given its prominence and controversy, it is interesting to examine the rise of cryptocurrencies. 

As a raw draft, our visualization contains the following components. 

-	A line graph indicating the total number of cryptocurrencies over time
-	A pie chart indicating the market capitalization of each cryptocurrency 

We then zoom in on the two most significant cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin and Ethereum. For these two currencies, we will show: 

1)	A line graph containing price over time. 
2)	The amount circulating over time 

For both, we will then shortly go into the reasons why there was a significant rise/drop in the price or amount. 


## Feedback from class

-	We need to integrate more storytelling. What is the exact story that we want to tell? In the end, we decided to tell the story of how cryptocurrencies have risen, and what this surge looks like. 
-	The other group suggested that we potentially could discuss the upsides/downsides of cryptocurrencies. However, for now we do not see how this fits into our larger story. 
-	A more fruitful suggestion was to include a short explanation of how cryptocurrencies work through Block chain technology, since not everyone might be familiar with this concept.
